# git-gpg

Put on your [tin-foil hat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat) for a second...

Are you worried about the NSA / Github / your VPS provider stealing your
private source code? (Remember, you are wearing a tin-foil hat.)

git-gpg helps protect your precious work. It lets you securely store your git
repositories on an untrusted server.

When you pull changes, it:

1. Runs rsync to download encrypted .git database files from a remote server to a local directory.
2. Decrypts the .git database files to form a "staging" repository.
3. Pulls from the staging repository into your local repo.

When you push changes, it:

1. Pushes your local changes into the staging repository.
2. Encrypts the .git database files in the staging repository.
3. Runs rsync to upload the encrypted .git database files to the remote server.

Simple.

## Requirements

To try git-gpg you will need:

+ Git and gpg installed on your system.
+ A git repository with top secret code.
+ A gpg private key. For help, see the [gpg cheat sheet](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~lockhart/gpg/gpg-cs.html).
+ A healthy sense of paranoia.

## Installation

Copy the `git-gpg` script to a directory in your path. Git will automatically
use the script when you run a command starting with `git-gpg`

## Usage

Add an encrypted remote to an existing git repository:

    git gpg add myremote user@server:~/files/project.gpg

Pull the latest changes:

    git gpg pull myremote

    # You can use standard git options when pulling:
    git gpg pull --rebase myremote

Push new changes:

    git gpg push myremote master

    # You can use standard git options when pushing:
    git gpg push --verbose myremote master

Note: By default, git-gpg will use the `user.email` setting in git as the gpg
recipient. You can change this by editing the `.git/config` file, or by
running the following command:

    git config --local gpg-remotes.myremote.gpg-recipient new@recipient.com

## Other Approaches / Prior Art

I experimented with a number of other solutions before arriving at this
version of git-gpg, including the following:

#### Git Clean / Smudge Filters

Git provides a "clean filter" that will run right before a file is committed,
and a "smudge filter" that will run right after a file is checked out. One of
the intended use cases is to transform files from Unix line endings to and
Windows line endings and vice versa.

Some clever folks have hacked this so that the client filter decrypts a file,
and the smudge filter encrypts the file. While this is clever, it is not
recommended:

> If your "clean" encrypts and "smudge" decrypts, it means you are refusing
> all the benifit git offers.  You are making a pair of similar "smudged"
> contents totally dissimilar in their "clean" counterparts.  That is simply
> backwards.

#### The git-remote-gcrypt Project

Another approach involves a [remote
helper](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-remote-
helpers.html). The code is difficult to follow, but as far as I can tell, it
creates a git repository inside of another git repository. The inner git
repository stores encrypted [packfiles](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-
Internals-Packfiles). The outer repository is used simply for a transport
mechanism. That may be totally wrong, as the code is quite complex.

I don't trust software that is too complex. The lead developer seems to share
some of this sentiment:

#### An Encrypted Remote FileSystem

Another approach is to store the remote git repo on an encrypted filesystem,
and then mount it when pushing or pulling code. An intruder must time their
attackÂ to happen when the code is decrypted in memory. This raises the
difficulty level, but still leaves a significant weak surface. If you are
*truly* paranoid about your code, then it's dangerous to *ever* decrypt it
anywhere except for on your own computer.

#### Encrypted Patches

A previous version of this utility attempted transmit and store encrypted
patches rather treating the entire repository as a single blob. The was more
bandwidth efficient than the current version, but it had two main disadvantages:

+ Patches don't preserve the commit hash, so different consumers of the repo saw different hashes.
+ It is possible to have a valid git repository that cannot be re-created by exporting and re-applying all of its constituent patches in order.

The second disadvantage was obviously a show-stopper.
